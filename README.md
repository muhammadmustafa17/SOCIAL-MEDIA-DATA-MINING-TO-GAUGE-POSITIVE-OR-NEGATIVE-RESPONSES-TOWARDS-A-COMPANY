# SOCIAL-MEDIA-DATA-MINING-TO-GAUGE-POSITIVE-OR-NEGATIVE-RESPONSES-TOWARDS-A-COMPANY
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of airline-related tweets to evaluate customer opinions expressed on social media. The study implements a complete data-mining pipeline, including data preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and multi-class sentiment classification using traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM) as well as a transformer-based deep learning model (BERT).

By comparing classical linear models with contextual embeddings from BERT, the project highlights differences in accuracy, computational efficiency, and contextual understanding. The results demonstrate the strength of SVM on high-dimensional text data while also showcasing the contextual advantages of transformer architectures for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.
